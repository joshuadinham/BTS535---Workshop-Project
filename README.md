## Mobile app for tracking/sharing training (runs, weighlifting, etc)

1 - Describe the problem;
  A mobile application for a social network tailored towards fitness enthusiests is required. The app must have capabilities to track workouts across various disciplines including cardio and strength activities.
  This tracked information must be informative and be viewable and sharable between a user's connections on the platform. The vision is to create a platform where athletes and casual fitness enthusiests alike
  are able to have a platform to track and share their workouts and milestones. The key vision of the app is to "gameify" fitness. A social network for fitness enthusiests currently exists but is catered towards
  distance disciplines. The weight training community does not have a similar outlet.

2 - Propose a solution;
  An app available through iOS and android should be created which includes the tracking capabilities of weight training tracking tools as well as the social media and sharing capabilities of strava or similar apps.
  The app should have capabilities to estimate personal effort in relation to past workouts or others of similar body type and time availability to give each workout a "score" to support gameifying exercise.
  

3 - List the technologies required by the solution.
  - nosql database - since this will be a social networking platform, the requirement for large data and the large scalability capabilities provide advantages over a sql database
  - swift - the mobile appliction must be functional on both ios and android
  - kotlin - 
  - kubernetes - 
  - aws - deployment on aws provides an all inclusive management 
  - vuejs - a lightweight component based framework for web development. Any product in the modern day needs a website.
  

  alternatively, react native can be used to eliminate the need to separately develop
