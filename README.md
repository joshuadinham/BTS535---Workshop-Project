## Mobile app for tracking/sharing training (runs, weighlifting, etc)

### 1 - Describe the problem;

  The project we've chosen is a cross-platform mobile training application. We want this project to be able to track workouts based upon workout category. This is to give people the ability to have a historical representation of their effort and a visual pathway towards their goals. 
  We want the tracked information to be both informative and sharable between a user's connections on the platform. The vision is to create a platform where athletes and casual fitness enthusiests alike
  are able to have a platform to track and share their workouts and milestones. The key vision of the app is to "gameify" fitness. A social network for fitness enthusiests currently exists but is catered towards
  distance disciplines.

### 2 - Propose a solution;
  The main features for this application would be the ability for users to create accounts, creating workout logs that track different workouts, the ability to display workout history with graphs and statistical information, goal-setting and tracking within the application, and the ability to share workout summaries or achievements with others.
  The app should have capabilities to estimate personal effort in relation to past workouts or others of similar body type and time availability to give each workout a "score" to support gameifying exercise.
  

### 3 - List the technologies required by the solution.
  Since this is a cross-platform application, using something like React-Native would accomplish the ability to deploy the app on multiple platforms. React-native is a javascript based framework with a large community support. The backend can be supported using Node.js with MongoDB for storing workout related information. For the front end, designs for workout log forms, goal-setting interfaces, and graphs need to be made. Tools like figma can help with creating these features visually.
