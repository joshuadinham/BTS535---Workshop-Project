1. Introduction (mkleiman1)
   - This project aims to create an application regarding a users fitness and health status. A number of tools can be implemented for this to work, such as a template to demonstrate excercises, a meal plan, a calorie counter, a tool to track burnt calories, a method of account creation, workout creation, and a tool to easily manage your own workouts.
2. Overview (including objectives) (mkleiman1)
   - We are planning to develop our own application to facilitate fitness and health tracking. We will create this application as a team of programmers at seneca college. 
     2.1 Objectives
